Hi! I am Shiyu (Ariel) Liu, a PhD candidate in Agricultural and Biological Engineering at University of Florida. My research has been published in top journal like Electronics and Computer in Agriculture. My research focus on computer vision, especially 2D/3D object detection and tracking, AI-driven robotics, ML/DL models, and time serial prediction. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, discovering national parks, enjoying food, and working out.
